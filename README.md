# Example CRUD Application (Updated 2025 - Ertugrul)

# Set of tools
Node.js, **Typescript**, Docker, Jest, Ajv, Express, **PostgreSQL (SQL / Knex)**, Postman

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This repository was initially forked from a project started by the original author (dyshaev-working) to demonstrate a Knex/Typescript implementation. The entire codebase and structure have since been **fully reorganized, updated, and extended by Ertugrul96** to integrate modern architectural patterns and showcase expanded skill sets.
